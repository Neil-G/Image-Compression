# Image-Compression
Image Compression comparisons using singular and non-singular vectors 
Completed in Matlab
For comparison an image of the original cow image, the cow image compressed with a random basis and recompressed using 6% of the data, and the image compressed using an orthonormal basis and recompressed with 2% of the data are provided.
This project demonstrates the advantages of using Singular Value Decomposition in image compression.
